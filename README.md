# Friend Finder!

## What is Friend Finder?

Friend Finder is a personality based Friend Finding application. Using user input we compare the user to a compiled list of people and return the person that share the most similar responses.

## How was it implemented?

Friend Finder has two parts to it. Client side HTML & JavaScript as well as as server side JavaScript based on node

## Dependencies

Friend Finder uses the following node packages as dependencies:

* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - Used to start our server and listen for client requests
* [path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path) - Used to determine our routes


## Looking at the code:
* **server.js:** Contains the information to start our server and configure it
* **.gitignore:** File which instructs git to ignore the files contained in it

 
## Unpacking the app:
